Cell phones have gone from a sought-after luxury to a daily necessity. While
these devices provide convenient access to the outside world, they can be
problematic for educators. High school teachers can tell children in their
classes to put their phones away, but should professors have the same
control over grown men and women? The key is to create cell phone usage
policies that limit distractions without hindering student rights.
The primary argument supporting cell phone control in the classroom is the
fact that phones can be distracting. Not only do cell phones distract
instructors, but they may also distract students trying to pay attention to the
lecture. This is the same effect as a moviegoer looking at his phone in a
theater. Even if the phone makes no noise, the light from the screen is
enough to catch someone’s attention.
Arguments against cell phone control typically focus on safety concerns.
Should a crisis occurs in the classroom, students should have their phones
on hand to make a call. If a student has a child, he or she may need a phone
in case of a medical emergency. If the student is on call for work, he or she
will need access to a phone. The list of exception-worthy scenarios is
endless.
The best solution is to create cell phone usage rules that allow devices to be
accessible without disturbing other students’ educational opportunities.
Students should be permitted to keep their phones in their bags, pockets, or 

other belongings as long as the phones are on silent in class. Vibrate
settings may be permitted if the instructor does not believe it will distract
him or her, since the noise of the vibration may not be noticeable in a large
classroom. If a student needs to answer the phone during an emergency, he
or she can step out of the classroom to do so. This setup would give the
students and the instructor peace of mind.
Cell phone restrictions in classrooms should also include specific disciplinary
actions for breaking the rules. If a student is caught using the phone in
class, he or she should be excused for the rest of the day. Professors should
refrain from physically taking possession of a student’s phone because of
liability conflicts. If the phone is damaged while in the professor’s
possession, the school or the instructor could be held responsible for the
repairs. It is safer to ask the student to leave the classroom than it is to take
the phone away completely.
Each school, professor and student body is different. Colleges must adapt
their rules and discipline efforts to reflect the current needs of their
students. Eliminating cell phones in college classrooms is an over stretch,
but there are ways to balance students’ rights and instructors’ rights. With
the right amount of control and flexibility, colleges can create a pleasant
learning environment with maximum safety and minimal interruptions.

I think this is enough.
Good bye

Almost. This amounts to more than a half of world population. And even
though many scholars are concerned that spend too much time online, I
believe that Internet is not only for fun. It is also a great way to make some
extra pocket money without ever leaving the comfort of your home.
Being a student taught me well that I should always seize an opportunity to
make some cash and deal with student loans before it is too late. Since I
don’t have much time, I was looking for a job in the neighborhood, or that
would not take too long to get to. After some time spent on searching for
the perfect idea, I came to the conclusion that working over the Internet is
exactly what I, as a busy student, need. I do not have to leave my dorm to
get places which saves me much time and gives a chance to work on my
school assignments.
Besides, working on the Internet is excellent because you get to learn
various new technologies. I work as social media manager creating
campaigns for local stores aiming to make their product known and loved in
the area via social media. In the course of this work, I had to master several
tools that collect popular news, analyze content trends, help me plan posts
ahead of time, and even check my posts’ grammar. All these tools will come
in handy later at a college or maybe even at work. Technologies are
conquering the world, and being tech-savvy will definitely pay off.
